# i3statuspp

**i3statuspp** parses click events generated by [i3status](https://github.com/i3/i3status)
and allows you to launch external commands when an event matches a custom rule.

## Building

`go build`

## Installation

`go install` and adjust your i3 config:

```config
bar {
  status_command ~/go/bin/i3statuspp
  # to debug events, redirect stderr to a file:
  # status_command ~/go/bin/i3statuspp 2>/tmp/i3statuspp.log
  ...
}
```

## Configuration

Copy [config.json](share/config.json) to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3statuspp/config.json`

## Similar Projects

This project is very similar to [i3cat](https://github.com/vincent-petithory/i3cat) but has less features and is more
performant since it does not rely on external shell scripts.
